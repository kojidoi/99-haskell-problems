Problem 8
(**) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.

If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements should not be changed.

Example:
* (compress '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
(A B C A D E)

Example in Haskell:
Î»> compress "aaaabccaadeeee"
"abcade"
-}

main = do print $ compress "aaaabccaadeeee"

compress :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
compress [x,y] = if x == y then [x]
                           else [x,y]
compress (x:y:zs) = if x == y then compress (y:zs)
                              else x : (compress (y:zs))
