(**) Construct the minimal spanning tree

Write a predicate ms_tree(Graph,Tree,Sum) to construct the minimal spanning tree of a given labelled graph. Hint: Use the algorithm of Prim. A small modification of the solution of P83 does the trick. The data of the example graph to the right can be found in the file p84.dat.

Example in Haskell:

Î»> prim [1,2,3,4,5] [(1,2,12),(1,3,34),(1,5,78),(2,4,55),(2,5,32),(3,4,61),(3,5,44),(4,5,93)]
[(1,2,12),(1,3,34),(2,4,55),(2,5,32)]
