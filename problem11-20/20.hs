{-
Problem 20
(*) Remove the K'th element from a list.

Example in Prolog:

?- remove_at(X,[a,b,c,d],2,R).
X = b
R = [a,c,d]
Example in Lisp:

* (remove-at '(a b c d) 2)
(A C D)
(Note that this only returns the residue list, while the Prolog version also returns the deleted element.)

Example in Haskell:

Î»> removeAt 2 "abcd"
('b',"acd")
-}

main = do print $ removeAt 2 "abcd"

removeAt :: Int -> [a] -> (a,[a])
removeAt k xs = (xs !! (k-1), take (k-1) xs ++ drop k xs)
